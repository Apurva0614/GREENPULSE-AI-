GreenPulse is an AI framework monitoring India’s urban green cover. Using Global Forest Watch data and KNN imputation, it introduces the Green Deficit Index (GDI) to quantify ecological balance. Through Random Forest regression and classification, it predicts risk levels from "Excellent" to "High-Risk," supporting UN SDGs 11, 13, and 15.
